            <p>
              Haii ^^ I'm Dezova/Dezzy. I'm some silly little trans gamer girl who plays Minecraft a lot. 
              You'll presumably see me on minehut.gg with my friends or by myself. I play prison RP or some PvP servers 
              in my free time or help work on new prisons!
            </p>

              <h3>Item Developing</h3>
              <p>
                Originally, item development was just a temporary hobby for a prison, but as I started making 
                my own prison which sadly was a fail but I was doing pretty good on items, so I decided to start 
                making more and more items. Now I'm very good at making items, and I'm trying to learn how to make 
                kits for prison servers. I still volunteer for items today if it's a prison rp.

              <h3>Moderating</h3>
              <p>
                Even though my moderating skills could use some work, I still don't let it put me down, 
                and I still have common sense with it. I only moderate prison rp or servers. I just generally like.
